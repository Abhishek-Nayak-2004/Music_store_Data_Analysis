# Music_Store_Data_Analysis
My first project on SQL as a data analyst was based on analyzing an online music store dataset. In this project, I worked with a music playlist database to explore and understand the data using SQL queries. The goal was to answer simple but meaningful business questions that could help the store track its growth and performance. This beginner-friendly project allowed me to practice essential SQL skills while gaining insights into how data can be used to support business decisions.

# Database and Tools
1. Postgre SQL
2. PgAdmin4
