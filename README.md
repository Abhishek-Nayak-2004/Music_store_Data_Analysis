# Music Store Data Analysis  

This is my **first SQL project** as a Data Analyst, where I analyzed an **online music store dataset**.  
In this project, I worked with a music playlist database to explore and understand the data using SQL queries.  
The goal was to answer simple but meaningful **business questions** that could help the store track its **growth and performance**.  

This beginner-friendly project helped me practice essential SQL skills while gaining insights into how data can support business decisions.
